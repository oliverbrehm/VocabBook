        After clicking on "Quiz", you will be promted to choose the learn direction.<br>
        You can either choose to cover the foreign language, which means you will see only the translation and have to guess the right foreign word, or you cover the translation and have to guess the translation for the corresponding foreign word. <br>

        While quizzing, you first think of the answer to the given translation/word before you klick on "Show answer".<br>

        <p style="font-size: 18px">
        You then check yourself by clicking "Right" or "Wrong" depending on if you knew the answer or did not.<br>
        The progress for each word will be saved as its "level". New words begin at level 0 and rise one level each time you anserwed right while quizzing.
        After rising up one level, the word will not be quizzed for a specific amount of time (between 1 day and 3 months, see table below). <br>
        If you did not know the anserwed while quizzing, the word will be reset to level 0.

        To check the progress of you words, click "Browse words" in the corresponding set's menu. In the "progress" section, you will see all of the set's words and their corresponding level.<br>
        Furthermore, any due words (meaning words ready to be quizzed for the next level) will be highlighted red and none due words will be highlighted green.
        You can also see how many times a word was anserwed right or wrong in the quiz.
