        <h1>Welcome to Vocab Book!</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Words in Vocab Book are organized in "sets". You can create sets, for example, for different languages or individual chapters of a class.
        The so created sets can be organized and studied individually. <br>
        <br>
        - On the main screen (image) you can, at any time, create a new set by clicking ont the "+" in the upper left corner (1). <br>
        <br>
        - Click on the set (2) to add words to it or to study.<br>
        <br>
        - If at any point you have a great number of sets, you can browse all of them by clicking on "All sets" (3).<br>
        <br>
        </p>

        <br>
            
            
        <p style="font-size: 18px">
        After clicking on a new set, you can now add words to it.<br>
        </p>
        <p align=center><img border=1 width=288 height=511 src="2-add words.png"></p>
        <br>
                
                
        <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Navigating back to the main screen, your newly created words will be shown under "Recent words".<br>
        If you have multiple sets, the new words of all other sets will be shown there as well.
        </p>
        <p align=center><img border=1 width=288 height=511 src="3-recent words.png"></p>
        <br>
                    
                    
        <p style="font-size: 18px">
        To view only words of a specific set under "Recent words", long press on this set. The set will be highlighted and only its words will be shown below in "Recent words".<br>
        </p>
        <p align=center><img border=1 width=288 height=511 src="4-filter words.png"></p>
        <br>
                        
                        
        <p style="font-size: 18px">
        As soon as a set contains any words, the corresponding set menu will display some more options.<br>
        <br>
        - If you choose "Quiz", Vocab Book will quiz you by showing only the translation of the words or the words themselves and coverying the counterpart. <br>
        Below the word "Quiz", you can inspect, how many words are currently due. If you new the answer to a quizzed word, it will not be quizzed for a specific time (depending on its progress), and after this time will become due again (learn more on this topic in the help page "Quiz algorithm").<br>
        <br>
        - Choose "Test" to test yourself on your studying progress. In this mode, you will have to type the answers to given translations. The result will later be saved for your inspection. <br>
        <br>
        - Select "Browse words" to view all the words of the set, ordered by progress, name or age.<br>
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Continue by navigating to the home screen by tapping back ("Vocab Book") in the upper left corner. You will be automatically promted to create a new set on the next page. <br>
        You can view this and other help pages again at any time in the settings menu (Main screen->Settings->Help).
